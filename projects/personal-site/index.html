                <p>” Creativity is the quality that you bring to the activity that you are doing. It is an attitude, an 
inner approach – how you look at things . . . Whatsoever you do, if you do it joyfully, if you do it 
lovingly, if your act of doing is not purely economical, then it is creative.” –  Osho</p></article>

                	<p>“Creativity is more than just being different. Anybody can plan weird; that’s easy. What’s hard is to be as simple as Bach. Making the simple, awesomely simple, that’s creativity” – Charles Mingus</p>

                <p>“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, the just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while” – Steve Jobs</p>
