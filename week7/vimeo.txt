Vimeo gives a great first impression when you first enter the website. It is very appealing to
the eye, which goes along well with what the website is used for; watching videos. Since you
can't have a video streaming website without users uploading videos, the first thing that you
see when you enter the website is the area in which to log in or to register. I think this is 
very appropriate because the users are the base of the website, and without them it wouldn't be
at all the same. I think it's neat that it even tells you that you have been to the webiste
before if you have.

The way that the homepage is a longer, scrolling page is something that I find is an asset to
the website. It's different than a traditional website that you see often. I'm not sure what this
style is called, but I really enjoy it. The homepage gives the user everything they need to 
explore the website. They can watch a video, log in, and even learn exactly what Vimeo does.
I really think that adding all this information on the front page is useful. Users who don't
know what the site is for can explore further onto the page, and the users that already know
what they are visiting for can just log in and not deal with the extra information that they
already know.
