I chose to use Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5 for my environment for developing websites. The main reason why I chose to use Dreamweaver is because I have already had experience using it in CAS 204 last semester. For me, it's very easy to use. I like how there are many options while choosing what your environment looks like. I chose the "coding" display because it lets me see the files in my computer on the left hand side. I also like that you can view it in code, design, or split display. This makes it easier to see if the changes you are making to your website are the correct ones. Although CSS properties do not show up correctly when using live preview, it is still helpful to see that the HTML changes are correct.

It also is very helpful when trying to find tags. If you aren't sure the exact wording, the program finds options for you. I like that it is so user friendly. As a beginner, it helps to have a program that is able to help you get what you need. It prevents me from spending lots of time on the internet looking for solutions to my problems. Dreamweaver is definitely the program that I am most comfortable with while creating websites.
