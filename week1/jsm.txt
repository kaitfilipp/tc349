My initial feeling toward this website was confusion. I was confused as to what the website
was for. The homepage just starts right off with showing blog posts. I was curious who Jason
Santa Maria was and where to go from the home page. After exploring for a bit, I realized that
he is a graphic designer and this was his site that he made as an experiment for online art
direction.

In structural terms, the website is designed well and looks very clean. I can tell that he is a designer because
there was a lot of graphic images that other sites wouldn't usually have. I also could tell
that it was a personal site, not a corporate site. The content is what threw me off. If I
were to make a website to promote myself and my skills, I would personally have more of my 
work as the front page headliner rather than having someone take the time to search for it
on the website.

As I went on to read the blog posts, I also noticed that they were sort of hard to read.
The copy was all centered on the page and the font size was a little big. For me, the size
of the text was was made it the most hard to read. It didn't feel like a natural movement.
I personally would have made the text smaller and maybe justified it to the left and fill up
more of the width of the page.

Overall, the website is clean and sleek. It's not hard to navigate through. The navigation bar
is straightforward and takes you to exactly where you would need to go. The only critique I
have is to change the home page, advertise the work more, and make the copy posts easier to read.
