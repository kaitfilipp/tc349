<p>
To begin my research, I visited the site Foldable.me and wrote down the sections of the website that were displayed. I made physical index cards because I am a very visual person.
I work better with things in front of me, so I figured that would be the easiest way to collect my data. I used three subjects in additional to myself. Each of my subjects were instructed
to organize the index cards into groups where the cards were related. I didn't specify any groups or any certain number of groups.</p>

<p>
After recording my results and comparing them to the original site, I found that my subjects sorted the aspects of the website pretty similarly to how the website is currently set up. The most common grouping was the social media links. Most of the sorting was nothing that surprised me. The only thing that people got confused about was the support and sponsored by links. Other than that, it seems as though the website is pretty well laid out in terms of readability.</p>
