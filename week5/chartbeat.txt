Charbeat's homepage does a great job of telling their audience exactly what their service can
do for you. The information is organized in a non-traditional way, but it is functional. Each
section is informative and eye catching. It is very easy for the user to move from section to
section. As a user that did not know what the website was about, I had a much better understanding
after I was done reading through the homepage.

The only downside I see to this that if you aren't a front end web developer, you can easily
get confused as to what the website is about. At first, I really had no clue what this site
was offering me. In my opinion, I feel like there should be some type of introduction or 
biography that tells you what the website is for. Although if you look at the other side of
it, people who aren't web developers will probably not be the target audience that visits
this web site.
