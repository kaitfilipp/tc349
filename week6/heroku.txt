The first thing I noticed when I was taken to the Heroku homepage was how visually appealing it was.
The homepage is very well organized. What I also like about it is how it is accompanied so well with
images and icons. It was very well stated on the top of the page what Heroku is and what it can do for
you. This makes it very user friendly and can be read by a wide range in audiences. I also enjoy how the
navigation bar is set up. It’s right at the top so it is easy to see. It also has the links named simply so that
you can get to exactly where you want to go on the website.

What I didn’t like about the website were the color choices. I love the dark tones the website has, but to
me the text seemed to get lost because of the lack in contrast, most specifically near the bottom and the
footer of the website. I noticed that they have a feature for when you hover over the link (for example,
“We’re hiring, critical production apps, Heroku Partners, and Register for Waza 2013) the icon and text
brighten up, but to me it should be easy to see in the first place. I also noticed that the only responsive
text is the bit with the telephone number, which I found odd. Overall, the information layout and design
work well, but the colors and readability could be improved.
