Etsy is a website that I like to frequently look through. I think its a cool concept that
people can create their own shop and sell things that they have made. It lets people find
unique and vintage items that they may not find at a regular store. I like how the website
home page is set up because it's very easy to navigate. Because there are so many products
that Etsy offers, you can browse the specific category for what you're searching for. It's
easily found at the left side navigation bar, and at the top you can easily search for a
specific product or seller that you have in mind.

Since Etsy has many different types of target audiences, the homepage needs to be easy
to navigate. Etsy does a great job in implementing this. I also like how they have handpicked
or featured items on the front page that pull you into the site and allow you to see the many
different things that they offer.

Etsy is also very easy to set up if you're a seller, which are the people who make Etsy what
it is. If it was difficult to set up an account and sell your products, then sellers would
be turned off by the difficulty. Because Etsy is so user friendly in buying and selling, many
people enjoy using it. Overall, I think this site is well put together. It's unique and offers
people unique products, which is appealing to many people.
