<h1> Panic.com Critique</h1>
<p>The website Panic is a very well organized website. Their homepage clearly states what they do, and how to get to where you want to go on the site. The visuals are very appealing to the eye. Everything is clearly organized and nothing seems out of place or confusing. Personally, I like the simplicity of the site. What is needed to be said is said and there’s no extra information to distract the viewer. </p>

<p>I really enjoy how everything is organized. It’s not set up like a traditional website, which makes it interesting to me. The design is consistent throughout all of the linked pages. They clearly care about their customer’s needs. You can easily find ways to contact people for help, tutorials to help you use their programs, and organized information to help you learn about what they are offering to their customers. </p>

<p>The only aspect of the web page that has bothered me is the size of the text and the link images. In my opinion, everything seems kind of big, so it takes effort to scroll through and find what you need. It’s not a major issue in my mind, but I can picture that if the size of the text and the images were just a tad smaller, the website would be just a bit easier to navigate. Overall, the site is very user-friendly and caters to Panic’s customers. </p>
