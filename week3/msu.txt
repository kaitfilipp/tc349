The MSU homepage is a well set up page that caters to many different users
that use this website. In my opinion, it's a great reflection of MSU. Lots of different
people with many different needs come to visit this homepage. MSU has done a great
job of designing it so that all of these people can find exactly what they need
quickly and efficiently. The navigation bar is a good tool to help users specify
their needs into a smaller category that leads into more specific information, such
as academics, where you're led to graduate or undergraduate students, athletics, and
engagement with the school.This makes it easy to use and navigate, which is of course
a plus for a homepage.

Although many users are probably going to the website to find information about the
university, they are lead to stories that are both interesting and also help the 
user learn more about MSU. Showing users things like Spartan Sagas and 
recent news about the university on the home page is a good way to bring in an
audience without weighing down the homepage with useless information. These stories
tell a lot about our school, and have a good place on the homepage of MSU's site.

The homepage is also very interactive, which is something that I personally like. You
can interact with the Twitter feed through the MSU Talk application, check out their
Facebook page, and even support the school all on the homepage. Overall, I believe the
site does a fantastic job in organizing information so users are not dragged down or 
confused on where to go, especially with such a vast audience.
